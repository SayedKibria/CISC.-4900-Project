This project is a 2D top-down RPG inspired by the classic Pokémon franchise but with a twist: instead of turn-based battles, players engage in real-time combat, actively controlling their Pokémon during fights. The game maintains core features like exploration, wild Pokémon encounters, and trainer battles but changes the experience through action-based mechanics. This project explores real-time systems in monster-taming game, focusing on responsive controls, and AI enemy behaviors.
